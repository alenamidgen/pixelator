# pixelator

This program was created to pixelate images. It takes an image and the desired new dimensions of pixels and displays and saves the new image. For user convenience, the new image has roughly the same number of pixels as the inputted image, the newly created "pixels" are instead blocks of pixels that are the same colour. This gives the effect of pixelization while keeping the new image at a size that is reasonable.
